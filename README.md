### ✅ What I Learned Today

- 🔸 **Creating a Testimonial Card Component**  
  Built a reusable React component to display user testimonial cards dynamically.

- 🔸 **Using Data in Array Format**  
  Stored multiple testimonials in a JavaScript array and accessed each entry using indexing.

- 🔸 **Navigating with Left/Right Buttons**  
  Implemented navigation using **left (`FiChevronLeft`)** and **right (`FiChevronRight`)** icons to switch between different testimonials.

- 🔸 **Working with Icons**  
  Used `react-icons` to add quote marks (`FaQuoteLeft`, `FaQuoteRight`) and chevron buttons for navigation.

- 🔸 **Modern CSS with Tailwind**  
  Styled the entire component using Tailwind utility classes:
  - Responsive layout
  - Hover effects
  - Rounded profile images
  - Z-index layering
  - `w-fit` to control button width
